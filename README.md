## How to use mods
- Changing Names

Change the nameconfig.txt file to whatever you would like it to say, the number at the top is how fast the name changes (20 - 999)
- NoClip

Hold down the "B" button on the right controller to activate noclip (make sure not to fall through the floor or you will get kicked)
- Mod Menu

Hold down the left grip button to activate the menu (NoClip and Super Monkey go really well with eacother, being able to fly with noclip)
*the text hitboxes are somewhat janky, hit the buttons with the side of your hand to press them easier*
