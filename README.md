This mod pack contains

## How to use mods
- Changing Names

Change the name_config.txt file to whatever you would like it to say, the number at the top is how fast the name changes (20 - 999)
(ex.
  file has:
  "20
  Pbbv
  pBbv
  pbBv
  pbbV"
  the mod will change your name in the order you set the names at at speed of 20)

- NoClip

Hold down the "B" button on the right controller to activate noclip (make sure not to fall through the floor or you will get kicked)
- Mod Menu

Hold down the left grip button to activate the menu (NoClip and Super Monkey go really well with eacother, being able to fly with noclip)
*the text hitboxes are somewhat janky, hit the buttons with the side of your hand to press them easier*

# How to install
1. Use Monke Mod Manager to install bepinex and other libraries. (i reccomend installing all of them)
2. once that is done installing find where the gorilla tag files are, go to ```Bepinex/plugins``` and put the zip/rar file in to the folder
3. Unzip the rar/zip file, take the mods out of the folder named "PBBVPAK" 
4. Boot up your game and return to monke (with superpowers)
